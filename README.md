# Bridging the Design-Dev Gap Workshop
Welcome to the 'Bridging the Design-Dev Gap Using Penpot' workshop repository! This workshop is designed to guide you through the process of seamlessly translating Penpot designs into code.

## Workshop Overview
In this workshop, we'll walk through a practical and iterative process of bridging the design and development gap using Penpot. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we'll do:

1. **Design in Penpot**:
Start by crafting your designs within the Penpot environment. Leverage its intuitive interface and innovative features to create visually appealing and functional designs.

2. **Code Integration**:
Once your design is ready, we'll seamlessly integrate it with code in this repository. Copy and paste the generated code snippets, and witness the real-time translation of your Penpot design into functional code.

3. **Real-Time Visualization**:
Experience the immediate impact of your design decisions on the codebase. As you make changes in Penpot, observe how these modifications manifest in the code, providing a dynamic and interconnected view of your design and its corresponding code.

4. **Iterative Changes**:
The workshop doesn't stop at the initial integration. We'll guide you through making iterative changes in both the Penpot design and the codebase.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a hands-on understanding of how to harmoniously synchronize design and development efforts using Penpot, from the initial design phase to iterative refinements, all within a collaborative and efficient environment.
Let's code in tandem with design!
